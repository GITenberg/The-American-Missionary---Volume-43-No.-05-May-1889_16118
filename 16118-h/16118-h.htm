<h2><a name="FINANCIAL" id="FINANCIAL"></a>FINANCIAL.</h2>

<p>THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY presents its greetings for the month of May. Six
months of our fiscal year are now in the past. The half year which we
anticipate includes the summer time, when many of the friends of the
ignorant millions to whom we are sent, are absent from their churches.
The months of May and June ought to swell the stream of love and service
against the season when the demand will continue and income will be
small.</p>

<p>We appealed last month for an increase of the contributions in <i>church</i>
collections. We renew and emphasize that appeal, for these collections
are the steady streams on which we rely to keep in motion the wheels of
the large and ever enlarging work of the Association. We believe that
the interest in this great work is on the increase. We rejoice that "the
most prolific missionary field ever opened to any Christian people&mdash;
right here at our doors," is gaining upon the interest and benevolence
of the churches year by year. Never were the friends of the cause mote
responsive; never was the work more hopeful. The work enlarges, and the
people's faith enlarges. Their gifts to Christ for his poor were never
freer.</p>

<p>We have been greatly favored with special gifts. Every one of them is
needed. It is a blessed thing that one can plant his benevolences in
some special institution or feature of work, and know that the
influences are to follow on after the giver has gone to a higher world.
But we do hope that the CHURCHES OF CHRIST, AS CHURCHES, will not fail
to keep step with the providences of God in their church contributions.</p>

<p>It is also true that some fear that the day of LEGACIES is to come to an
end. Indeed, there are those who take a solemn comfort in bewailing and
fearing that everything is to come to an end. They mix a pound of
forebodings with an ounce of faith. If, for some unseen reasons in the
movements of life and death, legacies do not appear with the regularity
of insurance tables, they think the day of legacies is dead.
Nevertheless legacies will continue as long as Christians pass from
earth to heaven. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>There will always be faithful souls who will remember
Christ and his cause in their wills. There will always be those who may
not be able to divide their estates and to dispose of portions of them
while they live, who will yet provide that they may see their works
following them, when they shall look down from a world redeemed, to a
world for whose redemption Christ lived and died. There will always be
legacies, and the American Missionary Association, so long as it follows
in the steps of Christ in such mission as it has, will not be forgotten.
The legacies will come, because they ought to come. The people of God
will remember this work in their wills because they ought to do this,
and God will take care that what Christian stewards ought to do, shall
be done.</p>

<p>We thank God for SPECIAL GIFTS. We thank God for LEGACIES. We also thank
God for the ability and faith and sacrifices of those who cannot plant
institutions or build or endow schools, but who live and give that which
provides for the unceasing CURRENT EXPENSES. Almost every one can do a
little more, and it is the many littles that make the difference between
a debt with a crippled work, and freedom from debt with healthful
growth. All along the lines, the calls for help are so urgent, that it
is painful for us, in the name of the church, to be constantly saying
"No!"</p>

<h2><a name="CENTENNIAL" id="CENTENNIAL"></a>CENTENNIAL.</h2>

<p>These pages will come before our readers amid the enthusiastic
rejoicings of a great nation celebrating the one hundredth anniversary
of its Constitution&mdash;a Constitution that has been tried and found
worthy.</p>

<p>The greatest strain to which this great charter has been subjected in
the past hundred years has been occasioned by slavery. The crisis cost
untold blood and treasure. The great strain of the next hundred years
will be what slavery has left behind it&mdash;a vast and growing black
population, and an imbittered race prejudice.</p>

<p>There is but one way to meet this strain of the coming century, and that
is by the education of the blacks. The task is great, but if the
American people will awake to its urgency and put forth the needed
effort, the crisis may be averted. We call upon all Christian people,
and upon all patriots, to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>begin this new century with the purpose to
increase their contributions for this great object. We ask them to begin
at once and to continue steadily&mdash;in church contributions, in personal
gifts, and, not to forget the object in the making of wills.</p>

<h2><a name="CONGREGATIONALISM_IN_GEORGIA" id="CONGREGATIONALISM_IN_GEORGIA"></a>CONGREGATIONALISM IN GEORGIA.</h2>

<p>Our readers are aware that there are two Congregational Organizations in
the State of Georgia. The Georgia Congregational Association was
organized in 1878, and is composed of about a dozen colored churches,
some of their pastors being white and some colored. The United
Congregational Conference of Georgia was formed a little more than a
year ago, is a much larger body, and is composed of white pastors and
churches. With a view to a possible union of these two organizations,
committees have been appointed by each, and, in another column, we lay
before our readers the propositions to that end, made by the Committee
of the Georgia Association. We cannot withhold our expression of
satisfaction with the Christian spirit exhibited in this document, and
the readiness to accept any possible alternative to secure the union.
The Congregational Churches of the country will feel an interest in
marking the progress of these negotiations, and will hail with delight a
consummation that will relieve the denomination from the embarrassment
of sanctioning two organizations in the same State that seem to be
separated only by the color-line.</p>

<h2><a name="NOTES_FROM_THE_SOUTH" id="NOTES_FROM_THE_SOUTH"></a>NOTES FROM THE SOUTH.</h2>

<h4>BY SECRETARY A.F. BEARD.</h4>

<p>Once more in Nashville. There is no question in my mind but that
Nashville is the educational leader in the South. It is a city of hills
which are crowned with institutions for white and black. These are the
beginnings of greater and better days for this part of "our country." My
duties have taken me to Fisk University. It is a college which has
justly won very high praise. Jubilee and Livingstone Halls are
significant names. One speaks of an historic event, and the other of an
historic person, but the work that goes on in both these large buildings
does no dishonor to one name or the other.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When Congressman Kelley, of Pennsylvania, was in Nashville, he visited
Fisk University. He afterwards told me that he could not conceal his
surprise at what he saw and heard and only with difficulty his emotion
when he arose to address the students.</p>

<p>I have now visited Fisk several times. I am each time more impressed
with the fidelity and quality of the work on the part of the students,
and the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>patient enthusiasm of the professors and of the teachers. If
there were to be no other or greater results than those of the past and
the present, all that has been done for Fisk University would be
justified.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>From Nashville to Sparta, Tenn., and then a rough, tough ride up the
mountain side, "rattling the bones over the stones" until at length we
have climbed the Cumberland Plateau. We arrive at no-where in
particular, which is named Pleasant Hill. Here are a neat church, which
is both church and school, and a sightly building of two stories with a
third under the mansard roof, which will accommodate forty boys. A few
houses are visible from the top of this building, but no one could guess
where forty mountain boys and as many girls might be living.
Nevertheless they have been discovered, and it was none too soon.
Missionary Dodge did not locate in Pleasant Hill before the time. He
realized this. He looked about him and looked up and down. He saw things
which were invisible. He saw castles in the air. It must be confessed
that the office at Reade Street, fearing lest it might "trust the
churches" too much, had not the faith which could take hold of these
castles in the air and anchor them to the soil of Pleasant Hill; but
Brother Dodge got his grapples out and pulled down a church building
from the heavens. Well done; now surely he should rest from his labors
and give himself and us time to breathe. No; a visible church only
stimulated his faith, it did not satisfy it. This church was a place in
which he could read the eleventh chapter of Hebrews every Sunday. The
result was the "Hall" for young men and for the teachers. Now we are in
it and are glad. The Massachusetts Principal gave us welcome, the
Oberlin Vice-Principal endorsed it, while the Matron materialized the
spirit of welcome in a way calculated to excite gratitude, from the fact
that missionaries cannot live absolutely on faith.</p>

<p>Next the young men were introduced. One of them was seized with
undisguised curiosity to behold a minister whose theological system some
institution had found it necessary to doctor. It is, perhaps, the first
instance on record in modern times where these semi-lunar fardels have
been looked upon with respect and curiosity. When "Brother Dodge" came,
congratulations were in order over his Church, his School and his Hall,
but he would have none of it. He was seeing another building floating in
the clouds, and could only talk of the invisible. It will, however, soon
be among things visible, for the missionary has his grapples out. It is
to be a Boarding Hall and Industrial Home for girls who will come into
it and learn to live and to be. "But, Pleasant Hill is not a town, it is
not a village, it is only by courtesy a hamlet. Where are your pupils?"
"The woods are full of them and they will come from near and from far,"
replies their young missionary of more than three score and ten years.
On Sunday, the church was filled; on Monday, the school was full; and
our heart was full of thanksgiving that God had come to these mountain
people, that hope would enter their lives and their <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>cabins, and that
these boys and girls would now step up in Christian manhood and
womanhood.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>One of the impressive thoughts which a visit to an institution like Fisk
University is sure to excite, is the relation of all this work to the
future. Apropos of this, the Rev. J.O.A. Clark, D.D., LL.D., of Macon,
Ga., has just written a little tract of fifty pages on "The Future of
the Races." He does not vote in New England, nor is he a Yankee; but he
is a good and true witness. He says, that the Races are running races
along the paths of knowledge and up the hills of science. These are his
words (pages 19 and 20): "Have they" [the colored people] "availed
themselves of the educational facilities? Have they profited by them? We
answer that they have been incalculably benefited. They have shown not
only that they can receive education, but education of a high order.
Their improvement has been so astonishing as to silence doubt and
caviling. Our Southern eyes have been opened to see it. Southern candor
is free to admit it. There are none who do not admit it but the
hopelessly prejudiced. I am persuaded that the <i>average</i> examinations in
the colored schools are better than the average in the white schools,
for teachableness is the basis of all education, and this universally
distinguishes the negro." Dr. Clark is not saying that the white boy may
not learn more easily and master more rapidly, but rather is telling how
the hare came out second in the race with his competitor not so fleet of
foot, but which had the gift of patient continuance in well-doing. Still
he accentuates the fact that "their improvement is astonishing." I am
sure that no one can visit Fisk University without having all his doubts
dispersed as to the future of the negro race. It is to have a future.</p>

<p>This leads me to quote the closing words of Dr. Clark's significant
pamphlet (page 52): "All Africa stretches out her hands to God; to the
work of delivering her fatherland from heathenism. God is calling the
blacks of these Southern States. They are to be the chief instruments in
giving the Gospel of Christ to the benighted land of their fathers.
Wherefore, let the work of Christian, and so sanctified, education go
on."</p>

<p>All this is true, and it means that in our American Missionary
Association the ministerial education must now be made more prominent.
When white missionaries can say, as one whose bones are in the soil of
the Dark Continent did say, "Let a thousand fall before Africa shall be
given up," the children of Africa must respond, "Africa shall be
evangelized by Africans." That is, we must have more and better
theological schools for the Negro people. The demand for educated Negro
ministers, who know what religion is, and what purity is, will be
greater and greater.</p>

<p>The demand for <i>missionaries</i> of the negro race who can realize that
"Christianity is a missionary religion," will be greater, also. We can
scarcely expect that those who came out of Egypt will become
missionaries to Egypt. The apprehension of missionary responsibility
comes with a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>developed Christianity. The missionary sense came to the
Apostles themselves very slowly. It came to the Christian Church slowly.
The African people in America, I trust, will seize upon it more rapidly,
for they have a large emotional nature and great faith. What they now
need is education and intellectual character, and those qualities which
give shape, and tone, and persistence, to the forces which direct and
control events.</p>

<p>Men who have been slaves may not take on this, and their children may
not in great numbers. But their children's children are coming on
multitudinously, and from them must go those who shall preach the Gospel
to their own race in Africa. For psychological as well as physiological
reasons this must be. Not only because they can live, and whites cannot,
in Africa, but because, other things being equal, they can do this work
better with their own race. Said Christ, "Go home to thy friends, and
tell what great things the Lord hath done for thee."</p>

<p>All of which says that the Fisk must now add to its great work a
thorough theological school, and must urge its students to listen to the
voice of God and to answer when God calls, "Speak, Lord, thy servant
heareth." More and better ministers are needed both for Africa in the
United States and Africa across the sea. He will give wisely who will
give quickly for this.</p>

<p>A Northern visitor in the South, writing in a recent number of <i>The
Advance</i> speaks of the rapid improvement of the Negroes in that
locality. He says that the Negro is prosperous; that commercially he is
honest; that one house has had no less than thirteen hundred names of
colored people on its books, each having a credit from a few dollars to
forty or more; that the Negro respects education&mdash;even if he is unable
to read himself, he wants, with all the determination of his soul, that
his children shall be educated; that the merchants say that they are
buying better and better goods, are learning the value of money, are
exercising wiser judgment, are becoming farmers and mechanics, are
becoming better men.</p>

<p>These items, taken from a long article, show the bright light glowing in
that locality. Of course the writer gives some dark touches to the
picture, and thus modified, it may be repeated of thousands of places

the dark side. There <i>is</i> a dark side, and it is dense. But if we can
only continue and enlarge the sphere of these bright spots, and kindle
others in new localities, the time will come when the light will
displace the darkness and the dawn of a new era will come. Friends of
the Negro race, patriots and Christians! furnish the oil for these

<div class="blockquot"><p>On the 13th of March, some of the Secretaries of the missionary
societies, and others interested in the welfare of the Indians,
had an interview with President Harrison and with Secretary
Noble, of the Interior Department. We were kindly received, and
the Secretary solicited information from us as to the methods in
which he could aid in furtherance of Indian civilization. A
number of suggestions were made in response, and the following
outline is given as a summary of the points presented to the
Secretary:</p></div>

<p>1. That the appointment or retention of all officers and employ&eacute;s in the
Indian service of the Government shall be on the sole ground of
fitness&mdash;that ability, integrity and an interest in the welfare of the
Indians, shall constitute the only required conditions. We are not
ignorant of the difficulties involved in securing such persons,
especially with the low salaries paid to some of these employ&eacute;s; and we
shall be abundantly satisfied with the purpose of the Government to
reach the nearest attainable success in this direction.</p>

<p>2. That the Government shall make adequate appropriations for the
establishment and maintenance of suitable schools for the education of
all Indian pupils&mdash;whether these schools be sustained and controlled
wholly by the Government or in co-operation with missionary societies.
The millions of dollars now due to the Indians by treaty stipulations,
for educational purposes, should not be idle in the National Treasury,
but should, as rapidly as possible, be devoted to their legitimate
purposes, and they should be supplemented as far as need be by direct
grants from the Government.</p>

<p>3. That the co-operation of the Government with the missionary societies
in what are known as <i>Contract</i> schools should be continued and
enlarged. We believe that no better teaching has been afforded to the
Indians than that given in these Contract schools. The educational
qualifications of the teachers, together with their disinterested and
self-denying characters and their religious influence and instruction,
render them pre-eminently fit for their places and successful in their
work. The experience of the past and the testimony of all unprejudiced
persons bear witness to this fact.</p>

<p>4. That compulsory education of Indian pupils be enforced, with liberty
of choice to the parents in the selection of the schools to which their
children shall be sent. The Indians are generally averse, or
indifferent, to the education of their children. The withholding of
rations in case of failure or neglect is usually an all-sufficient
motive for prompt compliance. Then, too, the parent, if a Christian and
intelligent, should be allowed to select the school for his child, and
not be compelled to send it to a Government school simply because that
may happen to be nearest.</p>

<p>5. The Government should adopt a liberal policy in regard to the use of
the vernacular in the Indian schools. We are all agreed that the English
language should be brought into use among the Indians at the earliest
practicable period. But the experience of all the past, in Indian
civilization <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>among the ruder tribes, has shown that Christian influences
have been most successfully brought to bear by the use of the
vernacular, in giving them the knowledge of the Word of God, in teaching
them a practical morality, and in preparing them for civilized life. We
ask, therefore, that no restrictions be placed upon Christian people in
their efforts for this great object.</p>

<p>6. We ask that the Government exercise an absolute impartiality in
dealing with the different denominations of Christians, in the
distribution of appropriations, in the granting of lands for missionary
uses, and in the appointment of officers, agents, teachers and employ&eacute;s.
We ask no favors in these respects, and we desire that none shall be
granted to others.</p>

<h4>BY REV C.J. RYDER, DISTRICT SECRETARY.</h4>

<p>"<i>Miss</i> &mdash;&mdash;:</p>

<p>"DEAR MADAM: I understand you have got the school, but I can't possibly
board you, as social equality is not custom in this country. I don't
think it would be pleasant for you nor for us, either. I wrote this in
order for you to look out some other place. You need not depend on
getting board with us.</p>

<p>"FEBRUARY 2, 1889."</p>

<p>This letter was written to a cultivated Northern young lady who had
graduated at one of the best high schools in the country and held a
special recommendation, besides her diploma, on account of her
excellency as a student and practice teacher. She went South to help
these people in their great need. It was for Christ's sake and in "His
name" that she entered this field. She secured board of a white family,
but when they learned that she was going to teach the blacks and seek to
lead them to Christ, this letter was sent her. Every door was closed
against this Christian woman because she was trying to save the poor and
ignorant! And it is eighteen hundred and eighty-nine of the Christian
era and in free America!</p>

<p>But this plucky Yankee girl did not so give up her school. She found a
boarding place in the home of one of our missionaries, two miles away,
and she tramps across these two miles twice a day, patiently putting in
her best services, to bring light into the dense darkness of the very
community whose doors were closed against her!</p>

<p>In connection with this incident of narrow prejudice read these words
from Dr. Haygood's "Pleas for Progress." "In all truth and common sense
there is no reason for discounting in any respect a white man or woman
simply for teaching negroes. It is absurd. I believe it is sinful."
These earnest words were spoken by the eloquent divine to his Southern
brethren, August 2, 1883, six long years ago. If they only carried the
conviction of the people to whom he appealed! How strangely they sound,
standing so close <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>to this letter refusing board to a young lady because
she is teaching these very negroes! "How long, O Lord, how long?"</p>

rule, but there was a good attendance and deep interest. All the

America were represented. The field work of the Woman's Association has

<h4>BLACK SAINTS AND WHITE.</h4>

<p>Do colored folks retain their complexion when they go to heaven? This is
a question of some importance to the members of the Diocesan Convention
of the Protestant Episcopal churches of Charleston, S.C. Not long ago
the Convention appointed a special committee to consider and report upon
the subject of the admission of negro clergymen and laymen as members of
that body. Their action was taken with the view of bringing the
Charleston churches, if possible, into harmony with the other Episcopal
congregations of the State. In 1887, the former had seceded in
consequence of the adoption of a resolution which the Charleston
brethren regarded as a virtual obliteration of the color-line.</p>

<p>Thursday, the report of the committee was made public. It proposes a
separate convocation for the colored churches under the ministration of
the bishop, and consents to the admission to the Convention of colored
clergymen who have been associated with the church for twelve months
prior to May, 1889. If the report is adopted, three negro ministers will
sit as members, but no lay delegates will be eligible. The committee
were willing to forego their prejudice out of deference to the holy
office. They felt that the color of a clergyman's skin, although it was
no doubt a very serious ground of objection when it happened to be
black, should not overcome the respect due to the sanctity of his
official calling. His cloth, so to speak, saved him, and what would have
been denied to the man it was possible to concede to the priest.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the gravity of the question, "Do colored folks
retain their complexion when they go to heaven?" is obvious. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>concession which the committee of the Diocesan Convention make is but a
re-affirmation of the Charleston brethren's aversion to anything that
smacks of an approach to association of the two races on terms of
equality. If there are colored saints in Paradise, it will be utterly
impossible for the Charleston white saints of the Episcopal denomination
to feel at home there. The only chance of reconciling them to a heaven
so liberally disposed would depend on the adoption of some such plan as
that recommended by the committee as a <i>modus vivendi</i> in the church on
earth. That is to say, if the colored saints were corraled by
themselves&mdash;if their convocations were separate from the convocations of
the white saints&mdash;if they were not admitted to the white circles of
celestial society as equal partakers of the privileges of the heavenly
kingdom&mdash;the Caucasian angels from Charleston might be willing to pass
their eternity in such a place.</p>

<p>It is very essential for them, therefore, to know whether there are in
fact any colored saints in heaven; and, if there are, whether the
divisions of the Father's house into "many mansions" admits of an
arrangement whereby the angelic brunettes may occupy one set of quarters
and the Charleston blondes another. Until these problems are solved to
their satisfaction, we do not see how our Christian friends of the chief
city of South Carolina can contemplate a future life with any degree of
equanimity. Their faith may be equal to the removal of mountains and
their virtues may entitle them to all the felicity of the spirits of
just men made perfect, but if it is the rule of the "happy land, far,
far away" that a black saint is just as good as a white one, how much
more rational it would be for them to prefer annihilation to
immortality.</p>

<p><i>Pleas for Progress.</i> By ATTICUS G. HAYGOOD, D.D. Publishing House of
M.E. Church South, Nashville, Tenn. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p>Dr. Haygood is a Southern man who stands with his face toward sunrise
and not sunset. As a writer, he is interesting and vigorous. He
sometimes forgets to take off his "Titbottom spectacles" when he looks
southward, but he puts in tremendous blows against the wrong which he
sees. This volume before us contains papers and addresses delivered at
various times and places, both North and South. It is a very valuable
book for those who desire to learn what the really Christian people of
the South think on these great National problems that the American
Missionary Association is helping to solve.</p>

<p>The lecture on "The Education of the Negro," delivered at Monteagle,
Tenn., and published in this volume, is a sample. Dr. Haygood states
"four root objections" to negro education: 1&mdash;Ignorance; 2&mdash;Stinginess;
3&mdash;Prejudice; 4&mdash;Fear that education will "spoil the negro as a laborer"
and bring him into "social equality" with the whites. The author shows
the absurdity of all these objections.</p>

<p>The volume is full of statistics and will prove a valuable mine of
facts. The discussions are clear and generally convincing. We commend
the book highly.</p>

<p><i>Rev. S.C. McDaniel and others, Committee of the United Congregational
Conference of Georgia.</i></p>

<p>DEAR BRETHREN.&mdash;Having been appointed by the Georgia Congregational
Association as a committee to confer with you in reference to a union of
the two bodies represented by you and us, we desire to express to you
our gratification at the receipt of your request for such a conference,
and our earnest desire that such a union should be consummated. With
this end in view, we would respectfully submit for your consideration
the following propositions:</p>

<p>1. We cordially invite the churches composing the United Congregational
Conference to become members of the Georgia Congregational Association.
Upon the acceptance of this invitation by the United Conference, we
agree to recommend to the Association the passage of a vote immediately
placing upon the roll of the Association the names of all the churches
of the United Conference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>2. In case the foregoing proposition should not be acceptable to you, we
propose that each of the bodies represented by us should pass a vote
disbanding its organization, with the understanding that all the
churches of both bodies should then come together and form a new
organization. Upon the agreement of your committee to recommend to the
United Conference the adoption of this proposition, we agree to make a
similar recommendation to the Association.</p>

<p>3. If neither of the foregoing propositions should be acceptable to you,
we propose that the United Conference place upon its roll the names of
all the churches and ministers of the Georgia Association. Upon the
agreement of your committee to recommend such action to the United
Conference, we agree to recommend to the Association the adoption of a
vote declaring its organization disbanded as soon as the churches
composing the same are received by the United Conference.</p>

<p>With reference to the foregoing propositions we would say further:</p>

<p>It is our conviction that any union between the organizations
represented by our respective committees should be as comprehensive and
thorough as possible, and that to this end the churches of the Georgia
Association should be enrolled as members of the District Conferences,
in fellowship with the United Conference within whose respective
boundaries the Association churches may be located. And the foregoing
propositions are made with the understanding that a vote shall be passed
by the United Conference recommending the District Conferences to
receive the Association churches as hereby suggested.</p>

<p>Of these three proposed methods of union, our own preference is for the
first. As the Georgia Congregational Association is the older body and
represents the historic Congregationalism of the State, going back not
only to the early years succeeding the Civil War, but even, in the
record of one of its churches, to the colonial period preceding the
Revolution, we feel that a respect for the traditional usages of our
polity would suggest the absorption of the newer churches by the
Association as being the older State organization. But as in our opinion
the result to be achieved is of more importance than the method by which
it shall be achieved, we would not insist upon the method of our choice.
If more acceptable to you, we should gladly form a union on the basis of
either the second or the third proposition already stated. Our chief
desire is for a complete and hearty union, in which, acknowledging the
fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man, we may live and work
together in the love of Christ, the Elder Brother of us all. That our
Heavenly Father may graciously help us all in perfecting and maintaining
such a union, is our earnest prayer.</p>

<p>Your brethren in Christ,</p>

<h4>REV. JAMES WHARTON.</h4>

<p>You last heard of my work, I believe, from Memphis, Tenn., where God
revealed his gracious power among the students of LeMoyne, and also at
the Congregational church. Altogether, some one hundred and thirty-four
professed a hope in Christ during my visit there. I then went to
Jackson, Miss., to hold services in the new church there; a pretty
little building, situated in a very central and prominent part of the
city. For eleven nights, I preached to not a very large, but to an
interesting congregation. Twelve professed conversion, their conversion
proving a source of great joy, not only to themselves, but to their
friends and acquaintances.</p>

<p>I also visited Tougaloo University and spoke to the students. Between
fifty and sixty at the close of the address arose for prayer. I feel
sure if I could have spent a few days with them, that most of them would
have decided for Christ, but they remain under the good and wise
instruction of the President, Rev. F.G. Woodworth. I hope to visit them
again.</p>

<p>I then went to New Orleans, to find the Central Congregational Church
recovering itself under the leading of the pastor, Rev. Geo. W.
Henderson. We believe that it will steadily grow, and be a great
influence for good in that large and wicked city. At Straight
University, I found the religious interest going on quietly and steadily
under the care of Professor Hitchcock and Rev. W.L. Tenney, some cases
of conversion taking place during the week of prayer.</p>

<p>I came to Montgomery three weeks ago, and a revival there has surpassed
any I have seen for the last thirteen years among the colored folks of
the South. In fact, many of the old-time people say they never saw such
a deep interest manifested in this city. The third night the church was
filled to overflowing, and hundreds were outside the door who could not
get in. The power of God came down upon the people in such a way that at
the close of the preaching the seekers fairly ran to the front benches,
taking them by storm. All around the front they sat or knelt. We placed
chairs in rows on the platform, and the crowd was so thick I could
scarcely get a place to stand. The pastor, Rev. R.C. Bedford, and the
Christians, worked hard among the unconverted, and now at the close of
the three weeks' services, more than two hundred are rejoicing in a new
found hope.</p>

<p>One case was that of a young man, the son of a Methodist preacher, both
deaf and dumb, who gave reasonable evidence of conversion as the love of
God filled his heart, and another was a young man who had been a wild
young fellow, who had at the time of his conversion a five barrel loaded
revolver in his pocket, and which I now have. One whole family is now
rejoicing that God has brought salvation to that house; father, mother,
son and four daughters are among the converts. Another father rejoices
over four of his sons and daughters converted. Husbands and wives have
started together on the road to Zion. On the streets and wherever you
go, the people <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>are talking about, and rejoicing over, the conversion of
some of their friends or relations.</p>

<p>This finishes another winter's work among the dear colored people, which
has been one of the happiest and most successful I have known for many
years.</p>

<p>The Connecticut Normal and Industrial School, Thomasville. Ga., closed
its winter term, for a few days' vacation, on March 26th, with
appropriate exercises. The <i>Thomasville Daily Times</i> says, "The growth
and management of the school is very gratifying to our people, and
everyone wishes it continued success and prosperity." The <i>Thomasville
Enterprise</i> speaks of "the results of the seven sweet-faced patient lady
teachers," and adds, "If yesterday's exhibition was a fair sample of
what the pupils can do, the American Missionary Association, and the
corps of teachers it has employed, have not labored in vain; that a
great deal of hard, honest work has been done, was fully exemplified."</p>

<p>Again we are reminded that <i>Thomasville</i> is not <i>Quitman</i>, and also of
the fact that Southern people are generally quite generous in their

<p>On Saturday, March 16, the great household at Fisk University was
suddenly saddened by the announcement of the death of Mrs. Bennett, who,
after an illness of four weeks, was called to her rest.</p>

<p>In 1867, Mr. and Mrs. Bennett gave up their work in a pleasant Northern
parish, and came to Fisk University, where they have labored together
for almost twenty-two years. During these years, Mrs. Bennett has been
not only an efficient helper to her husband and a wise and tender mother
to her children, but has contributed much to the work of the school. Her
strong mind and fine intellectual tastes especially fitted her for life
in an institution of learning. During the last few years, she gave much
time and labor to the preparation of a botanical collection for the
Scientific Department of the University.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett was also the warm personal friend of the young people.
Since her death, many tender expressions from present and former
students bear witness to appreciation of her quiet, earnest, Christian
character, as manifested both in her own life, and in her ministry to
others. Why such a life, apparently so indispensable to her husband and
children, and so helpful to a large body of young people, should be thus
suddenly terminated we cannot understand. We can only accept the
dispensation of Him "Who doeth all things well."</p>

<h3>STUDENT'S LETTER.</h3>

<h4>HOW I WAS EDUCATED, LED TO CHRIST AND INTO THE MINISTRY.</h4>

<h4>BY REV. SPENCER SNELL.</h4>

<p>My first lessons from books I received in night school. At this time I
was employed as dining-room servant by a family in Mobile. I did my work
during the day, taking a little time here and there for study as best I
could, and went to school at night. I was first employed at $3.50 per
month. Fifty cents of this I took each month to pay tuition. The tuition
in this school was one dollar per month, but I was receiving such small
wages that a woman who was employed in the same yard, and who went to
the same school, persuaded the teacher to let me go for fifty cents. I
remained with this family about four years, and went to night school
much of the time. I suppose they considered my services more and more
valuable as I became more enlightened, for, during the four years, my
wages were increased from $3.50 to $10 per month. As my wages increased,
I had more tuition to pay also, for during my study in the night school
I had several teachers and paid some of them as much as two dollars per
month, and so anxious was I to acquire an education that I would have
paid five dollars had it been required, even at a time when it would
have taken all my wages to do so. While I was a student in one of these
night schools, I chanced one day to see a newspaper which a colored man
who knew me had thrown into the yard for me. In this paper I read an
article telling about Emerson Institute, a school of the American
Missionary Association, and the commencement exercises soon to occur
there. The school had been in Mobile for several years, but I had heard
nothing of it till now. As soon as I read of these exercises, I
determined to see them, for I had never heard of such exercises before.
When the time came, I went one night, accompanied by a few of my fellow
night-school students. We were well pleased with what we saw, and I said
to them that I meant to enter that school when it opened the next fall,
and that I meant to be an educated man if I could. I soon began to carry
out my purpose, for in a few weeks I left my employment in that family
and went back into the country, from whence I had gone to Mobile, and
took the examination and began teaching public school. By this means, I
earned money enough to go back to Mobile and become a pupil of Emerson
Institute, not in the fall of 1873, as I had hoped to do, but in the
spring of 1874. I shall ever feel grateful to the man who threw over the
fence for me the article from which I learned about that good school,
for I am sure I am quite a different man to-day from what I would have
been but for reading that article. Precious to me is the memory of those
days during which I took tuition in the night-school, where the key was
put into my hand and the door of knowledge was opened to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>Next to God I am grateful to the American Missionary Association for
having received training in a Christian school, where I was led to
Christ and felt called to the Christian ministry. When I lived on the
plantation, before I went to Mobile and received instruction in the
Christian school, I had heard the uneducated colored ministers preach
and they had endeavored to lead me to Christ, but I could not accept
Christ in the way they had presented Him to me. I remember well how they
told us that in order to find Christ we must fast and pray for a number
of days. I remember, too, the unsuccessful attempt which I made to give
myself to Jesus in this way. I was a farm boy and was plowing hard every
day, and it was hard work for a boy of my age to follow the mule all day
in the tough grass, and I always felt like eating when meal time came,
but still I tried to become a Christian by doing as the minister said I
must, and so for a few days I ate no breakfast, no dinner, and no
supper, though I worked on. They told us, also, that we must not go to
bed at night, for if we did the wicked one would make us sleep all night
and we would fail to pray through the night, and they said we must pray
all night. For several nights I did not go to bed at all, but would lie
down upon the doorstep that I might get up often through the night and
go down the hill to pray, for we were instructed to "go down in the
valley." Of course after a few days I became tired, sleepy and
discouraged, and gave up. I did not make another attempt till I became a
student in Emerson Institute. One of the lady teachers in that school
became interested in my soul's salvation. She read the Bible to me,
talked to me, and prayed for me, and made the way of life and salvation
seem so plain and simple that it was not long before I accepted the Lord
Jesus as my Saviour.</p>

<p>My heart overflows with gratitude to that Christian lady whenever I
think of my conversion. There is no favor which one person can do for
another so great as that of leading him to Christ.</p>

<p>Soon after I was converted I felt inclined to enter the ministry, and
was advised to go to Talladega College and there take a theological
course. I wanted to go but did not see any way to get there, to say
nothing of how I was to stay there, but a lady from the North had been
visiting one of our lady teachers at Mobile, and heard me deliver an
oration in a prize contest. She said she liked it, and after she went
back home she sent me $25 to help me in my education. I had been praying
that a way might open for me to go to Talladega, and I felt that the $25
came in answer to prayer. I used up the money in getting ready and in
going to Talladega. I wrote Dr. G.W. Andrews, who has for a number of
years been instructor in theology there, that I was anxious to go and
enter his department, but I had no money, and he wrote me, if I had
money enough to get there, to come on. Thank God that I went, and that a
way was provided for me to stay there and finish the course of study;
and now I am out in the ministry and trying to do something for Him who
has so wonderfully led me and blessed me.</p>

and keep it there for use during the breaking up of the river. Being
very busy with some writing, I asked Mr. Cross to take my team over when
he started to return to the White River, sending a man with him. Mr.
Cross's team went over safely, but mine, which Mr. Cross himself was
driving, broke through and were drowned, in spite of every effort of the
two men. Mr. Cross had a narrow escape. He managed to save the wagon,
but the horses went down with harness on as they were driven. Mr. Cross
took the loss so to heart, that together with the strain and agony of
the moment, it quite prostrated him. He started for White River in a day
or two after, though I felt that he was hardly fit to go."</p>

<h2><a name="FIRST_FRUITS" id="FIRST_FRUITS"></a>FIRST FRUITS.</h2>

<h4>REV. C.L. HALL, FORT BERTHOLD, DAK.</h4>

<p>In the fall of 1879, a young Gros-Ventre Indian named <i>Dahpitsishesh</i>,
"The Bear's Tooth," began to attend the day school at Fort Berthold, and
although he was over twenty years old and not very quick to learn, he
surpassed the younger pupils by his industry. He attended the day
school, in the day time or in the evening, quite regularly during the
winter, and became a help to the missionary in translating parts of
Scripture into the Gros-Ventre language.</p>

<p>He wore his long hair braided behind, and banged and plastered with clay
in front so that it stood upright, and he dressed in blanket, breech
clout, leggings and moccasins, and the lower joints of several of his
fingers were cut off in accordance with the Indian custom of mutilating
themselves at the burial of a friend. His first appearance to a new
teacher who came the following spring caused her no little trepidation,
but she soon learned to prize him as her best pupil, and the next year
the influence of God's word upon him was seen by his saying, after
recounting some of his Gros-Ventre religious fables, in which his belief
had been shaken; "I have been coming to school now more than a year.
Since reading these books about God and angels I cannot sleep at night,
but have had dreams. I think some harm will come to me. I am poor and
cannot help myself, but I pray God to keep me from harm, and I want to
trust him."</p>

<p>From that time on, we hoped he would take a decided stand for Christ. As
yet, none among his people had been converted. A few passages of the
Bible and a few words of song had been given to the Gros-Ventres in
their own tongue, and every Sabbath there were attentive Indian
listeners, but <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>would there ever be a Gros-Ventre convert? "The Bear's
Tooth" continued to come to us, and learned to understand quite fully
the requirements of our faith. He became a trusted helper in charge of
the mission cattle and the milking, working regularly as few Indians
would do at Berthold, and he soon had stock of his own in which he took
great pleasure. He read the Bible on Sabbath afternoons with one who was
soon called to her reward; it was almost her last prayer that he might
be saved. He came in spite of dissuasions, jeers, and even persecutions
from his people, and yet he took no stand for Christ. Three years after,
there were Indian inquirers, and he helped to explain to them the
demands of Christ, but they all felt that "the way was too hard for
them" and "went away sorrowful."</p>

<p>Some of the young people who had been taken away to school and removed
from the opposition of their people had confessed Christ, but there were
none to face it here and say that they loved him. "The Bear's Tooth"
took a wife in the Indian way, unwilling to marry, and removed, as it
seemed, away from our influence, to a claim forty miles up the river
from our mission station.</p>

<p>But God dealt with him and afflicted him in the loss of his babes, and
of his stock, so that he said, "It seems as though I could acquire
nothing. Explain it to me; the Indians say it is because I follow your
teaching." I taught him from the book of Job, and the words of Christ.
His soul was hungry, and when he came once in two weeks for his
government rations, he sought the bread of life at the mission. Finally,
after nearly eight years, one summer day he came and sat on a bench in
the shade of the house in a little flower garden, and after we had
talked awhile, he said to the missionary: "Good Voice, now I can; I will
be faithful to my own wife, I will keep Sunday, I will pray and avoid
the dances and other heathen customs; when you think best I will come
down and be received into the church." That was a glad moment. To clasp
the hand of the first Gros-Ventre brother in Christ, won through a
strange tongue and from a people who had sat in darkness for eighteen
hundred years since the great light shone in Galilee!</p>

<p>I said, "Bring your wife and friends with you to Christ." He went home
but soon returned, saying sorrowfully: "My wife and my friends are none
of them willing. If I join I think it must be alone." "Well," I said,
"let it be so," and it was. His clothes were second-hand and old, and he
had no natural attractiveness of appearance; but in a simple, manly,
determined way, he made his confession and was baptized before an
audience of Indians in the little mission chapel, (July, 1887), a poor
Indian, but another Daniel standing alone.</p>

<p>Then, as the man of Gergesa, he went home to tell his neighbors what God
had done for him. He had a Bible in Dakota, of which language he
understood something, and a few Gros-Ventre translations in writing, and
some attempts at hymns, and some pictures. With these he preached, in
neighbors' houses, and then he would report to me of his reception, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>ask me questions about the Christian life. A veritable man "Friday" had
come to me; I was no longer alone. Then why did his health fail, and he
forty miles away where I could not see him? But so God willed. Soon they
brought me the word: Your friend has gone. I gathered up his last words,
questioning his wife and lame old father. He wanted to see <i>his friend</i>
and tell him some things. He thought he did see him come in and then go
out before he could speak. He said, "I thought it was difficult, but I
joined with those who pray, and I find now it is only a <i>short</i> way. I
am going above." With his last breath and his Bible open, he asked to be
shown the way, that he might go in it.</p>

<p>The influence of a genuine life is strongest at home, and so it comes
that the wife is seeking to follow her husband. There are other converts
with us now, but we shall never forget this first Gros-Ventre "friend,"
(madakina); and although the story of his life is not a peculiar one to
white men, nay for that very reason, we are glad to write this record of
a once lowly, but now glorified, believer.</p>

<h4>BY REV. ROBERT G. HUTCHINS.</h4>

<p>Our First Church has recently enjoyed two peculiarly impressive
occasions; one the anniversary on the 17th of last month, of the Chinese
school, established by Dr. Pond; the other the reception, on the 3d
instant, of six Chinese brethren to church membership. To appreciate the
significance of these scenes, one must remember how contemptuous is the
prejudice which prevails on this coast against these inoffensive
strangers.</p>

<p>Nine or ten young Chinamen delivered addresses at the anniversary. They
spoke with remarkable simplicity, perspicuity and accuracy of English
pronunciation. In view of their perfect self-possession and propriety of
manner in the presence of the crowded congregation, one could scarcely
realize that nearly all of them were utterly inexperienced in public
speaking. The success of these humble representatives gave a hint of the
possibilities of a Christianized China. One of the speakers gave an
account of the conversion, sickness, death and Christian burial of a
member of the school, a youth of eighteen. The heathen relatives and
friends had attributed the illness to the boy's desertion of the
religion of his fathers, and had begged him to allow the burning of
idolatrous incense. But he had calmly resisted their appeals, and, in an
alien land, far from his father and mother, had pillowed his dying head
on the breast of the Saviour of mankind.</p>

<p>Low Quong, who superintends the mission, and who is true-hearted,
prudent and influential with his countrymen, showed with clearness, the
relation between the conversion of the Chinese in California and the
evangelization of China. It was news to many of his hearers that the
Christian Chinese of America are supporting native missionaries of their
own in China.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>The recitation by the school in concert of some of the sweetest and most
familiar of the Psalms and Scriptural promises, melted the hearts of the
hearers into sympathy. The old truths borrowed a new tenderness and
emphasis from these voices accustomed to recite heathen prayers. The
pupils sang in solo, in duet and in chorus. When "Over the Ocean Wave"
was rendered, some of us queried in our minds on which side of the ocean
wave God thinks the poor heathen live&mdash;the side from which these gentle
friends have come, or the side where their countrymen receive such
unchristian welcome?</p>

<p>Nothing could more effectually knock in the head mean prejudice than the
grateful words and kind spirit which characterized this anniversary.
Whatever may be the prospect of the Chinese over-running us, they
certainly <i>had</i> us that Sunday evening. Mrs. Sheldon, who has had large
experience in the work, and Miss Watson, are devoting themselves to the
mission with a beautiful fidelity and consecration.</p>

<p>Dr. Pond, who conducted the anniversary service, closed with an address
only too brief, but most felicitous and convincing. To the opponents of
Chinese immigration he is accustomed to reply: "Can there be any better
way of keeping the Chinese at home than to have it known among the
fathers in China that their sons, if they come to this country, are
likely to be Christianized?"</p>

<p>Nothing could be sweeter or more cordial than the spirit of welcome with
which the six Chinese brethren were received into covenant. Not an
officer or member breathed an objection to their reception. Had there
been in any heart any lurking Phariseeism concerning them, it would have
been rebuked, if not exorcised, by hearing them sing with us at the
Lord's table, in broken accents, "Rock of Ages," by observing their
devout bearing and by witnessing the affecting baptismal scene. These
brethren came to the church approved by Dr. Pond, by the Chinese
missionary, Low Quong, and by the vote of the Christian Association, and
after an examination by the pastor.</p>

South are being trained to a world-wide interest in missions.</p>

<p>A Woman's Missionary Union for the State of Louisiana was organized in
connection with the Congregational Association of the State. The meeting
of ladies was well attended, and the interest was manifested in their
hearty response in favor of joining the sisterhood of State Unions. The
officers of the Union were selected from both the white and colored
churches, the church at Hammond being thus represented.</p>

<p>At the annual meeting of the General Association of Congregational
churches of Mississippi, which met at Tougaloo, March 28th, a Woman's
Missionary Union was organized. Mrs. A.V. Whiting was chosen President,
Miss Julia Sauntry, Chairman of the Executive Committee, and Miss S.J.
Humphrey, Secretary. Although it is but a small beginning, we hope the
day is not far distant when Mississippi will take her place with other
States in missionary work.</p>

<p>The Woman's Missionary Union of the Central South Conference was
organized April 13th, at Knoxville, Tenn.; Secretary, Miss Anna M.
Cahill, of Nashville.</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_THE_PENNIES_GREW" id="HOW_THE_PENNIES_GREW"></a>HOW THE PENNIES GREW.</h2>

<p>Not the pennies that lay hidden away in the bank, nor the pennies that
were spent for candy. O no; but the honest, hard-working pennies that
had a work to do and the heart to do it.</p>

<p>These work-a-day pennies fell into the hands of a mission band called
"Willing Workers." It was in the summer-time when they began to stir
about and see what they could do for missions, and when winter came
along there was a pleasant little festival, and the pennies came
together, and brought just as many with them as they possibly could.</p>

<p>For these were "talent" pennies, and they had been invested for the
Lord. One of the very pleasant features of the festival was the reading
of little papers, telling how the pennies grew. And we are going to let
the children see some of these very papers. For all this is exactly
true, and took place in a pleasant village in the State of New York.</p>

<p>About ten dollars grew out of a little more than twenty pennies. We have
not room to publish all the little papers, telling how the pennies grew
into dollars, though all are of great interest. In some cases the
original penny was invested, and then turned over and over. This is an
instance:</p>

<p>"With the original cent I bought some darning-cotton and darned
stockings, some for a cent a stocking, but most of them for a cent a
hole. I then bought thread and crocheted some lace which I sold for 25
cents. I hemmed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>two aprons for 5 cents apiece, and some towels for one
cent apiece. Afterward, I bought another card of darning-cotton. After
paying for the thread and cotton, I have left the sum of one dollar.&mdash;
PHEBE."</p>

<p>"Rosie," who brought in $1.66, says nothing about her penny, but tells
how she earned money, as: "Hitching up horse for grandpa, 10 cents;
topping carrots, 12 cents; keeping the fowls off the wheat, 25 cents;
sweeping, 17 cents," etc., all showing honest, hard work. But the penny
started it all, perhaps.</p>

<p>Here is "Nellie's," with an idea in it:</p>

<p>"With my penny I bought a pen and holder, and sold it for 10 cents. I
dug a pailful of potatoes for 3 cents, and mended a hole in grandpa's
sock for one cent. I then bought a little chicken for 5 cents, and let
it grow into a big chicken, and sold it for 36 cents, making a total of
50 cents."</p>

<p>Well done for Nellie!</p>

<p>Only one more of these charming little papers can we give in full,
though we should love to have our little readers see every one of them.</p>

<p>"The first thing I did with my penny, I made some edging which I sold
for 10 cents; then I sewed it on for 5 cents, which made 15. Then mamma
said if I killed 15 flies she would give me a penny, and so I earned 14
cents in that way. Then I had 29 cents. I then took away 25 cents and
bought some ice-cream, and sold it for 8 cents a dish, and received 48
cents for it. Now I had 52 cents. Then I took 8 cents away from it for
some linen, and 4 cents for some braid, with which I made some lace and
sold it for 70 cents, which leaves me $1.11. Then I sold some flowers
for 14 cents, making $1.25. This is what I did with my penny.&mdash;LIBBIE."</p>

<p>"Freddie" and "Tusie," little brother and sister of Libbie, did well
with their pennies. Tusie increased hers to 35 cents, while Freddie's
grew to 48 cents. Each of these little people gathered all the string
they could find and made it up into balls, which they sold.</p>

<p>"Meda" made a ruche for grandma, crocheted lace, and speculated in
butter, gaining in all 66 cents.</p>

<p>"Davie," Meda's brother, found a generous customer in grandpa, who
bought a pen-holder and then gave it back to be sold over again. Davie
also speculated in tallow, and increased his penny to 50 cents.</p>

<p>"Helen" invested in a penny tablet, sold it for 3 cents, and crept up by
degrees to the place where she could buy material for an apron which she
sold for 35 cents. She made another apron and a tidy, and cleared 55
cents.</p>

<p>"Lulu" bought a penny rubber and sold it for 2 cents, bought darning
cotton, pins, cloth for apron, etc., and increased her penny to 50
cents.</p>

<p>The pennies have been growing, and that is good. But love has been
growing too, in these young hearts, and that is better!</p>

<p>May the "Willing Worker" bands multiply all over our great land!</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
